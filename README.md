## **Required modules**:
selenium, csv, time, random, gspread, mutagen (see youtubebot.py for complete list)

## **Depenencies**:
Google Chrome, Python 3.6

## **Description:**
API to promote a YouTube channel through a complicated chain of social interactions using Python automation. 
It features Google API integration for Google Sheets and is based entirely on xPath for element selection, which is quite extensive and features many possible API interactions for automation of YouTube. Smart features such as Google Trends integration and channel interactions for video uploading with live status updates in Google Sheets. All configurable. Includes a video generator feature, which remains unfinished but is briefly laid out.


## **The project likely does not work anymore with Google's new detection for Web Automation. It may work if you pay for credits.**
